            <div class="display_none">In recent weeks, WB Games Montreal has been shedding new light on its upcoming
                Batman game sans Batman, Gotham Knights, and some details have left fans skeptical about the direction
                the game is taking with Bruce Wayne’s surviving Bat Family. First, a 13-minute gameplay video revealed
                that GK’s incarnation of Nightwing makes use of a jet-powered glider, while Red Hood has been endowed
                with wild “soul energy” abilities. By far the most troubling revelation came via a bio for Batgirl,
                published to the game’s website, that suggested she’d recovered from her disability through “raw
                willpower and determination.”

                During a Q&A session in Gotham Knights’ official Discord channel, creative director Patrick Redding
                addressed the backlash over the insensitive Batgirl character bio, and provided insight into Nightwing’s
                glider and Red Hood’s new powers.
                The character bio for Batgirl on the Gotham Knights website discusses Barbara Gordon’s history as both
                Batgirl and the Oracle. The Oracle was Gordon’s tech-genius alter ego who offered invaluable support to
                Batman after a confrontation with the Joker, depicted in The Killing Joke, left her paralyzed. The
                reason WB Games Montreal faced criticism for the bio is that it stated Gordon was spurred by the death
                of her father to “recover from her wounds so that she could return to active duty as Batgirl.” This led
                fans to call out the game for employing the tired comic book trope of heroes overriding their disability
                through sheer willpower.

                Redding revealed in the Q&A that, in the wake of the criticism they received, the team worked in
                collaboration with AbleGamers, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving accessibility in the
                video game space, “to learn about different types of spinal injuries and the potential for someone to
                regain mobility.”
                “As with many of our characters and plot elements, the circumstances around Barbara’s injuries differ in
                some important ways from how it’s been portrayed in the comics,” Redding said. “Barbara has been through
                multiple surgeries followed by a lot of physical therapy and pain management [in Gotham Knights].”

                Redding went on to say that the team acknowledges the criticism, and has replaced the contentious
                description to read: “With extensive training and rehabilitation, she recovered from her wounds, and
                returned to active duty as Batgirl.”

                Redding went on to discuss the creative decisions behind Nightwing and Red Hood’s traversal abilities,
                chiefly Nightwing’s Green Goblin-esque glider, and Red Hood’s new jumping ability.

                During the 13-minute gameplay demo, Nightwing is shown traversing rooftops with the help of a
                techno-glider called the Flying Trapeze. According to Eurogamer, Nightwing’s techno-glider is a
                throwback reference to Batman’s retro Bat-glider. Redding said the creative team liked the idea of
                Grayson utilizing one of Batman’s stealth drones in order to gain more altitude to perform his
                death-defying acrobatics.

                “[The Flying Trapeze is] designed to feel a bit improvised, and dependent on his extreme athleticism,
                which fits Nightwing’s approach to everything,” he said. “Flying it has such a different feel from
                Batgirl’s cape-gliding, and it blends really well with his bigger parkour and leap moves, as well as
                with grappling.”

                The most bizarre reveal in Gotham Knights’ gameplay trailer, for me at least, was Red Hood, aka Jason
                Todd, leaping through the skies of Gotham in a clearly supernatural fashion using his new ability, the
                Mystical Leap. Redding said the development team leaned on Red Hood’s origin story–which involves death
                at the Joker’s hands and subsequent resurrection in the Lazarus Pit–when approaching his new powers,
                intending them to serve as a manifestation of Todd growing into his own.

                “We really liked the idea that as Jason starts to confront the trauma of dying and being brought back,
                he begins to be able to tap into some lost abilities,” Redding said. “In the same way that he’s tried to
                reinvent himself from anti-hero to hero while retaining his strengths, he discovers he can channel these
                mystic talents in ways he finds familiar: Through his physicality [and] in how he moves, but also in how
                he fights and even how he uses his weapons.”

                Redding explained Todd’s new ability as one “just one manifestation of those powers” he received after
                being revived in the Lazarus Pit. I only hope those powers include fixing my son’s skull so he doesn’t
                have the bone structure of a Lego.

                Gotham Knights is slated to release on October 25, now only for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

                I’m not going to do a “Would you kindly” joke. I’m not going to do it. I’m better than that. Besides,
                you don’t need to be brainwashed to know how good a deal it is to get all three Bioshock games on PC for
                absolutely nothing at all via the latest Epic Games Store giveaway.

                Starting today, you can grab, download, and install Bioshock: The Collection on PC via the Epic Games
                Store. This bundle includes remastered and touched-up versions of Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and Bioshock:
                Infinite. The collection also comes with all of the single-player DLC packs and expansions released for
                the games, including the beloved Bioshock 2 DLC, Minerva’s Den.
                As with past freebies from Epic, it’s yours forever once you create an account and redeem the game. And
                as usual, this offer is only for the PC versions.

                Don’t wait too long to pick up the Bioshock Collection for zero dollars and zero cents, as the deal
                expires on June 2. After that, Epic will move on to its next free giveaway. Last week it was Borderlands
                3.

                Bioshock and Bioshock 2 are immersive sims, or at least I and many others think so. Some don’t think the
                games are as deep or mechanically interesting as older imsim hits like System Shock, or newer genre
                entries like Prey. Regardless, in Bioshock and its sequel, you explore a creepy and (mostly) abandoned
                underwater city, Rapture. It was once a utopia, but greed, superpowers, and rich people ruined all that.
                Typical. Throughout the games you upgrade your cool powers and weapons, helping you take on all sorts of
                nasty splicers, the deadly remaining residents of the failed underwater utopia.

                Bioshock Infinite is a bit different. It’s a more straight-up shooter, though it does feature some of
                the same powers and mechanics as the first two games. In Infinite you play as Booker, a man sent to save
                a young woman who’s locked up in a tower inside a giant floating city run by a madman. If you are
                playing the game for the first time ever, in 2022, be prepared for some very blunt and not particularly
                sophisticated political allegories. But if you can get past some of that stuff, you’ll discover a fun,
                action-packed, and beautifully made shooter with a trippy ending and some great DLC.

                All three games are worth playing, especially if you can get them for free, which we’ve established you
                can. Just head over to the Epic Games Store and grab them before June 2. And who knows, maybe one day
                the next Bioshock game will be released. Perhaps it will be better than Infinite. One can hope!

                It feels like the current console generation is only just getting started, and yet, a corner of the
                internet spent a good part of this week obsessing over the next iteration, the presumed mid-generation
                hardware refreshes for Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X/S. The commotion is all thanks
                to an event hosted by TV maker TCL, as first reported by Polish news site PPE.

                This current console generation officially kicked off in November 2020, with Microsoft’s release of not
                one but two next-gen machines. The Xbox Series X is the flagship, capable of rendering games at 4K
                resolution and running them at frame rates of 60 fps. Alongside the Series X came the smaller Xbox
                Series S (though not capable of hitting 4K, it’s still a reliable little Game Pass machine). Two days
                later, Sony released two models of its next-gen console, the PS5. Both machines boast identical
                specifications, and can match the Series X’s 4K60 target. Only difference? One has a disc drive, the
                other does not.
                Sorry, sorry, slow down a second. Why are we talking about even newer next-gen consoles? It’s impossible
                to get the ones that are out today!
                You’re right! Thanks to a number of variables—including bots, an ongoing semiconductor shortage, and the
                general production woes that come with capitalism in a pandemic—buying a next-gen console remains an
                uphill climb. Though the Xbox Series S pops up regularly at big-box retailers, the Xbox Series X has
                only recently started to become readily available, and in erratic moments at that. Both models of the
                PS5 are still elusive.

                Yeah, and the timing itself seems too soon.
                It is and it isn’t. Last time around, the “mid-generation refresh” came about around three, four years
                into the console generation. The generation itself kicked off with the 2013 release of the PS4 and the
                Xbox One. Sony released its mid-generation refresh, the PS4 Pro, in 2016. That same year, Microsoft
                released a newer Xbox model, the Xbox One S, and followed that up in 2017 with the Xbox One X,
                calcifying a naming convention that’s destined to flummox gamers until the end of time.
                I hate it too.
                It’s needlessly confusing, yes.

                So, are we getting the PS5 Pro and whatever the heck the next Xbox is called or what?
                At the moment, the release of a PS5 Pro or a new model of Xbox Series consoles is entirely unconfirmed.
                Sony and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. This week’s flurry
                of speculation was spurred in part by timing. If such machines are due out in a year or two, based on
                the timeline of last generation, now (or now-ish) would be the time to pull back the curtain. And this
                year’s annual not-E3 marketing barrage is just a few weeks away, starting with Sony’s presser on June 2.

                But a lot of the dialogue has been stoked by a deck circulated from TCL’s event.

                Photos from the conference, published by PPE, showed a slide headlined “game console generations,” meant
                to promote TCL’s “2022 product introduction.” Under a subhed marked “gen 9.5,” the slide featured
                purported details about a “PS5 Pro” and “New Xbox Series S/X.” (Those photos served as the basis for a
                series of semi-viral social media posts.) It claimed an output of 8K resolution with frame rates of up
                to 120 fps—technically possible with this current generation of consoles, by the way, if you have the
                right display.

                There’s no indication that TCL has any insight into the hardware plans of Microsoft or Sony. A
                representative for the company did not respond to a request for comment.

                Did we get any good memes at least?
                Oh yes. The internet, as usual, had a field day. Non-Morb meme of the week goes to:
                That’s pretty good.
                Right? You really know conjecture has hit a fever pitch once the memes go mega-viral like that. Of
                course, rumors about a mid-generation refresh have circulated almost as long as this generation has gone
                on. The previously most significant round came in September 2021, when YouTube channel Moore’s Law Is
                Dead suggested the PS5 Pro could land in 2023 (with a sticker price of $700). It did not stoke memes to
                the same degree.

                But the timing really is undeniably hot right now. Beyond the ripe marketing window and the “evidence”
                from TCL’s conference, there are precious few big-budget games to get excited about these days, what
                with the wave of recent delays. It’s fun to get excited about stuff. And if fans know there are no big
                touchstone games on the immediate horizon, the potential of splashy new consoles—even just an
                announcement—is an easy thing to point to.

                Personally, I’m in no rush, beyond the fact that console manufacturers—and this might sound nuts—should
                probably ensure gamers can get their hands on the current models before releasing a newer, presumably
                pricier one. For me, there’s really one indicator it’ll be time for an upgrade: when my PS5 starts
                imitating a jet engine every time I try to boot up The Last of Us Part 3.
